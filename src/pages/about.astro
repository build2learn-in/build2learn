	<h2>What is Build2Learn?</h2>
	<p>
		Build2Learn is a dynamic community where people come together to build their ideas, learn new skills, and collaborate on exciting projects. We focus primarily on software development, though we've also seen teams successfully create hardware prototypes. Our mission is to help students and professionals learn through the hands-on experience of building small, usable product prototypes.
	</p>

	<h2>How Does Build2Learn Work?</h2>
	<p>
		Our community thrives through the participation of four key groups, each playing a vital role in our monthly events:
	</p>

	<h3>1. Organizers/Champions</h3>
	<p>
		A dedicated team of individuals who have come for more than 5 events. They want to be an active part of the community and coordinate events, facilitate connections between participants, and ensure everyone is actively engaged in the learning and building process. These champions create the environment that makes collaboration possible.
	</p>

	<h3>2. Volunteers/Experts</h3>
	<p>
		These experienced professionals share their knowledge and mentor others in specialized areas such as programming languages, frameworks, microservices, or IoT. Experts often lead small teams, breaking down complex tasks into manageable components for learners. They represent approximately 10-15% of event participants and are the technical backbone of our community.
	</p>

	<h3>3. Learners/Builders</h3>
	<p>
		The heart of Build2Learn, these participants actively work on building prototypes with expert guidance. They may bring their own ideas or join existing teams, working individually or collaboratively. Each builder comes with specific learning goals or skills they wish to develop through hands-on experience.
	</p>

	<h3>4. Visitors</h3>
	<p>
		Curious individuals who attend to observe our community in action. Many visitors, inspired by what they see, later return as dedicated Learners/Builders or even Volunteers/Experts, continually enriching our diverse ecosystem.
	</p>
	<h2>The Build2Learn Experience</h2>
	<p>
		Our monthly events typically run for 3-4 hours and follow this format:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Welcome and Introductions</strong> - Organizers kick things off, followed by participant introductions where everyone shares their project ideas or learning objectives.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Team Formation and Building</strong> - We break into small teams based on interests and begin working on product prototypes, applying classroom knowledge to real-world projects.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Mentorship in Action</strong> - Throughout the event, experts circulate among teams, offering guidance, troubleshooting assistance, and valuable insights.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Showcase and Networking</strong> - We conclude with project demonstrations, discussions, and community photos, fostering connections that extend beyond our monthly gatherings.
		</li>
	</ol>
