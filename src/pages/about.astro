  <h2>What is Build2Learn?</h2>
  <p>
    Build2Learn is a dynamic community where people come together to build their
    ideas, learn new skills, and collaborate on exciting projects. We focus
    primarily on software development, though we've also seen teams successfully
    create hardware prototypes. Our mission is to help students and
    professionals learn through the hands-on experience of building small,
    usable product prototypes.
  </p>

  <h2>How Does Build2Learn Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Our community thrives through the participation of four key groups, each
    playing a vital role in our monthly events:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Organizers/Champions</h3>
  <p>
    A dedicated team of individuals who have come for more than 5 events. They
    want to be an active part of the community and coordinate events, facilitate
    connections between participants, and ensure everyone is actively engaged in
    the learning and building process. These champions create the environment
    that makes collaboration possible.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Volunteers/Experts</h3>
  <p>
    These experienced professionals share their knowledge and mentor others in
    specialized areas such as programming languages, frameworks, microservices,
    or IoT. Experts often lead small teams, breaking down complex tasks into
    manageable components for learners. They represent approximately 10-15% of
    event participants and are the technical backbone of our community.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Learners/Builders</h3>
  <p>
    The heart of Build2Learn, these participants actively work on building
    prototypes with expert guidance. They may bring their own ideas or join
    existing teams, working individually or collaboratively. Each builder comes
    with specific learning goals or skills they wish to develop through hands-on
    experience.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Visitors</h3>
  <p>
    Curious individuals who attend to observe our community in action. Many
    visitors, inspired by what they see, later return as dedicated
    Learners/Builders or even Volunteers/Experts, continually enriching our
    diverse ecosystem.
  </p>
  <h2>The Build2Learn Experience</h2>
  <p>Our monthly events typically run for 3-4 hours and follow this format:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Welcome and Introductions</strong> - Organizers kick things off, followed
      by participant introductions where everyone shares their project ideas or learning
      objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Team Formation and Building</strong> - We break into small teams based
      on interests and begin working on product prototypes, applying classroom knowledge
      to real-world projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mentorship in Action</strong> - Throughout the event, experts circulate
      among teams, offering guidance, troubleshooting assistance, and valuable insights.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Showcase and Networking</strong> - We conclude with project demonstrations,
      discussions, and community photos, fostering connections that extend beyond
      our monthly gatherings.
    </li>
  </ol>
