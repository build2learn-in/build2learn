					<p class="text-gray-700 italic mb-4">“I fell into tutorial hell without even realizing it, I've been self-learning since my 12th standard, but it wasn't until my pre-final year that I became aware of it,The Build2Learn event truly opened doors for me.For the first time, I stepped out of the cycle of just watching tutorials and actually started building projects and referring to documentation,The environment, the pressure, the pitching  everything pushed me in the right direction,It helped me break free and finally build to learn.”</p>

					<p class="text-gray-700 italic mb-4">“Participating in the Build2Learn hackathon was a game-changer for me. It showed me just how much I can accomplish in just 3 hours—I surprised myself with what I was able to build in such a short time. Beyond that, the event brought together an amazing community of like-minded creators. I had the chance to network, exchange ideas, and draw inspiration from the incredible projects others were working on. Most importantly, Build2Learn helped me break through my habit of procrastination and actually start building. It was the perfect mix of motivation, creativity, and connection. Can't wait for the next one!”</p>
