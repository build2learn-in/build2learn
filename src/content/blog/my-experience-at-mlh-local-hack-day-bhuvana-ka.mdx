## Why this hackathon is special to me?
Both my son and i had registered for the Hackathon. This was the first hackathon for my teen son Devesh.Our joy knew no bounds when we got selected for the hackathon out of the 200 registrations. I wanted to work on a Tamil character recognition project using Deep Learning techniques. My son was interested in launching a community for SAT aspirants- SAThub.
